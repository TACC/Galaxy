//! ClientWindow is a socket-connected endpoint for receiving pixels
/*! 
 * ClientWindow is a class that provides a socket-connected
 * endpoint for receiving pixels from a remote renderer, maintaining
 * a asynchronously updated image buffer.
 * 
 * A viewer using this class will typically create an actual window
 * that will present the image, then a) watch the window for user
 * interactions that cause re-rendering, and b) update the actual
 * window pixels from the image buffer maintained by the ClientWindow.
 * 
 * The ClientWindow manages asynchronous update by using several 
 * pixel-resolution buffers:
 * 
 * pixels, which contains the current pixel contents of the window
 * as (r,g,b,a) floats
 * 
 * - frameids, which contains the most advanced frame ID encountered
 *   for each pixel. This is used to recognize new frames and 
 *   therefore the new pixels will replace, rather than accumlate 
 *   with, prior values
 * 
 * - negative_pixels, containing the sum of any negative pixels that
 *   arrive before the first positive values for the corresponding pixel
 * 
 * - negative_frameids, which are to negative_pixels as frameids are to pixels
 * 
 * - frame_times, holding the most recent modification time for each pixel
 * 
 * The ClientWindow implements two threads - the rcvr_thread, which watches the input
 * socket connection and modifies the above buffers when pixel messages arrive, and
 * the ager_thread, which runs every tenth of a second, looking for pixels that have 
 * not been updated recently and can be faded out.
