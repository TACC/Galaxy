/*! \file GuiRendering.h
 *  \brief  GuiRendering is a subclass of the Galaxy renderer's Rendering 
 *          class that knows to ship pixels that arrive from ray processing to
 *          a remote client - eg. the ClientWindow object in a connected client
 *
 * In Galaxy, a Rendering is a class that represents the destination for pixels 
 * from a particular visualization from a particular camera point.  When used in
 * a simple viewer that is NOT multiserver client/server, its role would be to
 * post pixels to a window.   For static rendering to a file, its role would be 
 * to aggregate pixels until the rendering completes, then provide the pixels to
 * be exported to a file.   
 *
 * The GuiRendering is a simple specialization of Rendering that knows 
 * about a socket connetion (the MultiServerHandler) and to ship received 
 * pixel packets across the socket connection to a remote client.
